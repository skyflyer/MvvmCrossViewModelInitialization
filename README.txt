SecondViewModel is requested as a result of an action from StartPageViewModel. 
It passes to a serialized object (ComplexObjectType) to the call, which should
be passed into `Init(string parameter)` method of the SecondViewModel as per post[1].

Note that if you put a breakpoint in the method `InitFromBundle (IMvxBundle parameters)`
this method will be called.
